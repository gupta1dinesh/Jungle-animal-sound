# Jungle-animal-sound
Design patterns, Abstract factory, factory method



This algorithm is designed using abstract factory and factory method to depict the animals (vertebrate) sound.
Additionally, logging was introduced in order to ease the daignosis of encountered problem during the run of the 
program. 

This algorithm is composed, and based on SOLID principle with proper application of design patterns. It successfully prints the animal 
sound with its irrespective alphabets-cases. It can be easily extended if you want to add other animals sound.


Thank You!!!
